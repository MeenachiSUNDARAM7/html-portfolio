<h1>The Best Movies According to Sundar</h1>
<h2>My Current top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>This anime is top class. Best World building and story building this series lit bit long. but I recommend to watch it will be a great experience to watch a epic story.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>This is like OG to many anime fans. This story is fantastic but too many fillers skip and watch.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>one of the best animation series and fight scence are so good and the story is also well written.</p>
<hr />
<h2>One Rom-Com Recommendation</h2>
<h3>Kaguya-sama</h3>
<p>This rom-com is so good and comedy is also epic and in starting pacing is lit bit slow after it will be good to watch.</p>
